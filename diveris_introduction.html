    <h1>My Name is John Diveris</h1>
	<p>I am a freshman Computer Programming and Development student.</p>
	<p>I have been thrilled to learn HTML, and am quite excited to begin understanding what all is possible within CSS.</p>
	<p>In my freetime I enjoy playing card games with friends, reading fantasy novels, and falling off of skateboards. </p>
